Exam Task: Build a Node.js File Streaming Server with Event Notifications
Scenario:
You are building a Node.js application that serves a file to clients over a network. The application should handle file streaming, monitor the progress of the stream using events, and notify the client when the transfer is complete.
Requirements:
1. Buffer Usage:
  1.1 Read a file in chunks using Buffer.
  1.2 Send these chunks to the client over a TCP connection.
2. Stream Usage:
 2.1 Use a Readable stream to read the file and pipe it to the network connection.
3. EventEmitter:
 3.1 Create a custom EventEmitter to:
   3.1.1 Emit an event when each chunk is read.
   3.1.2 Emit a final event when the file has been completely sent.
4. Network:
   4.1 Create a TCP server using Node.js net module.
   4.2 The server listens on port 3000.
   4.3 When a client connects, send the contents of the file example.txt to the client.

Expected Behavior:

1. When the server starts, it should wait for client connections.
2. When a client connects:
  2.1 The server reads the file example.txt in chunks.
  2.2 Each chunk is sent to the client.
  2.3 Progress is logged to the console on the server side.
3. When the transfer is complete:
  3.1 Notify the client with a message: File transfer complete!
  3.2 Close the connection.
